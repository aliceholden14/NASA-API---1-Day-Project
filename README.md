# NASA API App

In a team of 4, Shanice Basra, Emma Randle, Rebecca Jones and I were given the task to produce an app within a day relating to an API.

After spending some time planning using trello boards and disney ideation methods, we chose the NASA API documents ([source](https://api.nasa.gov/)) to produce an app that provided you with a picture of the day for a selected date and then as a stretch goal we wanted to provide the data for the pressure on Mars in a graph format.

## Instructions

If git cloning, please do an NPM install in your terminal.

## Future Goals

- Improve styling including making it responsive and the general UX/UI of the game.
- Specifically finish the graph view, possibly look into a component library such as chartJS to visualise the data.
- Refactor the code.
- Deploy the app.
